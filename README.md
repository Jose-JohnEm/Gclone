# Gclone
A bash script which can simplify you to clone a git repository (In progress)

Hello, I'm Jos√© and I'm studying informatic in Epitech LYON, and I live in France.
While I'm boring, I usually try to resolve some problems to simplify my life (even it just make me spent more time).

The first one here is about cloning git repositories; I found that some people struggled when they have to clone repositories
because of many things (command line, syntax, etc...).
But now, with Gclone you can clone more easily, you just have to know the git support (github, blih, etc...), the
name of the project and its owner.

In master branch :
I add some code that will allow you to register your git repositories and your main user, because, for my part,
I often clone my own repositories, so the next time you can type "gclone -m" so Gclone will only ask the name of your
repository. If you want to be unregistred, you can type "gclone --reset"


In devellop branch :
I want to make this task more easiest, so currently I'm trying to collect the repositories of
the user, so you will don't have to know the name of the repository
